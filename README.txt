    - Apparently homebrew install was not permanent ?
        Need to figure out how to make installations permanent?
        > If I open Ubuntu it works (alchemynte@LAPTOP-0SIH392K)
            * Brew works, atlas still does not work
        > If I open Ubuntu wSL, not (alchemynte@LAPTOP-0SIH392K)
    - Still having issues with atlas (Bad Address)
    * Might need to reconsider how I set up development environment
